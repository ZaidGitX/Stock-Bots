### StockBots Overview

This project focuses on developing iterative models by conducting a comprehensive analysis of stock market data to enable the production of toolsets that concentrate on assisting investors in facilitating strategic investment decisions, specifically on stocks within the S&P 500 index. It includes three main components: Classification, Time Series Forecasting, and a Recommender System. Each component serves a distinct purpose, from analyzing and categorizing stocks to forecasting future prices and recommending investment opportunities. The main components of this project fall into three distinct iterative versions: Version 1.0 (Classification), Version 2.0 (Time Series), and Version 3.0 (Recommender System).

### 1. Classification

#### Objective
The classification component aims to categorize stocks based on their fundamental data to determine their growth potential.

#### Methodology
- **Data Source**: The project utilizes a dataset containing various financial metrics for companies within the S&P 500.
- **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning and preprocessing are performed to ensure the dataset is suitable for classification tasks.
- **Classification Model**: Machine learning algorithms such as GradientBoosting, Random Forests and Support Vector Machines are applied to classify stocks into categories such as high growth, medium growth, and low growth based on features like Price/Earnings ratio, Dividend Yield, Earnings/Share, etc.
- **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.

### 2. Time Series Forecasting

#### Objective
The time series component is designed to forecast future stock prices based on historical data.

#### Methodology
- **Data Source**: Historical adjusted closing prices of S&P 500 stocks, aggregated on a monthly basis from 2010 to 2022.
- **Model Used**: ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model is employed to capture the trends and patterns in the time series data.
  - **Autoregressive Component (AR)**: Assumes today's value is based on a fraction of yesterday's value plus some noise.
  - **Integrated Component (I)**: Accounts for the differencing needed to make the time series stationary.
  - **Moving Average Component (MA)**: Models the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.
- **Implementation**: The ARIMA model is trained on historical data to predict future stock prices, providing valuable insights for investment decisions.

### 3. Recommender System

#### Objective
The recommender system provides personalized stock recommendations based on various user inputs and preferences.

#### Methodology
- **Data Source**: Integrates data from both fundamental financial metrics and historical stock prices.
- **Algorithm**: Utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to generate recommendations.
  - **Collaborative Filtering**: Analyzes patterns in user behavior and preferences to recommend stocks that similar users have shown interest in.
  - **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends stocks based on the attributes of the stocks themselves, matching user-specified criteria such as sector, risk tolerance, and investment horizon.
- **Personalization**: The system allows users to input their preferences, tailoring the recommendations to individual investment strategies and goals.

### Impact and Considerations

While the project provides robust tools for analyzing and predicting stock performance, several considerations are highlighted to ensure responsible use:
- **Data Limitations**: The accuracy of the models depends on the quality and completeness of the data. Any biases or inaccuracies in the historical data could affect the recommendations.
- **User Education**: Users are encouraged to understand the underlying methodologies and limitations of the system to make informed decisions.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular updates and audits of the models and data are planned to maintain the accuracy and fairness of the recommendations.

This project aims to empower individual investors with advanced analytical tools, bridging the gap between institutional and individual investors, and promoting informed participation in the financial markets.
