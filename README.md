# Time Series Forecasting - S&P 500 Stock Prices

## Objective

The time series component of this project is designed to forecast future stock prices for companies within the S&P 500 based on historical data.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project consists of historical adjusted closing prices for S&P 500 stocks. The data is aggregated on a monthly basis from 2010 to 2022, providing a comprehensive view of stock price trends over time.

## Methodology

### Model Used: ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)

The ARIMA model is employed to capture the trends and patterns in the time series data. The model combines three components:

- **Autoregressive Component (AR)**: Assumes that today's value is based on a fraction of yesterday's value plus some noise.
  - **Formula**: \( R_t = \mu + \phi R_{t-1} + \epsilon_t \)
  - **Behavior**:
    - \( \phi = 1 \): Random walk (non-stationary)
    - \( \phi = 0 \): White noise (stationary)
    - \( |\phi| < 1 \): Stable and stationary process
    - Positive \( \phi \): Momentum (positive returns follow positive returns)
    - Negative \( \phi \): Mean reversion (returns tend to revert to the mean)

- **Integrated Component (I)**: Accounts for differencing needed to make the time series stationary.
  - **Process**: Differencing involves subtracting the previous observation from the current observation, which helps to remove trends and seasonality.

- **Moving Average Component (MA)**: Models the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.
  - **Formula**: \( R_t = \mu + \epsilon_t + \theta \epsilon_{t-1} \)
  - **Behavior**:
    - \( \theta = 0 \): White noise
    - Positive \( \theta \): Mean reversion
    - Negative \( \theta \): Momentum

### Implementation

1. **Data Preparation**: The historical stock price data is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure it is suitable for modeling. This involves handling missing values, ensuring consistent data intervals, and transforming the data if necessary.
2. **Model Training**: The ARIMA model is trained on the historical data to learn the underlying patterns and trends.
3. **Forecasting**: The trained model is used to predict future stock prices. The forecasts provide valuable insights for investment decisions, helping to identify potential trends and opportunities in the stock market.

## Usage

To use the time series forecasting component:

1. **Data Loading**: Load the historical stock price data into your environment.
2. **Model Training**: Train the ARIMA model on the data.
3. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to generate forecasts for future stock prices.
4. **Visualization**: Visualize the forecasts to understand potential future trends.

## Considerations

- **Data Quality**: The accuracy of the forecasts depends on the quality and completeness of the historical data. Ensure that the data is accurate and representative of the underlying stock market trends.
- **Model Assumptions**: The ARIMA model assumes that the time series is stationary. If the data exhibits strong trends or seasonality, additional preprocessing steps such as differencing or seasonal decomposition may be necessary.
- **Limitations**: While the ARIMA model is powerful, it may not capture all aspects of stock price movements, especially in highly volatile markets. Use the forecasts as one of many tools in your investment decision-making process.

This time series forecasting component aims to provide valuable insights into future stock price trends, helping investors make informed decisions based on historical data and statistical modeling.
