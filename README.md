# Stock Recommendation System
Investors are often faced with the critical decision of which stocks to buy that best align with their investment interests. We aim to illuminate this decision-making process by offering essential insights that empower investors to make informed, astute investment choices. By providing solid, tailored recommendations on the top ten stocks to buy based on a single stock the investor is exposed to, we aim to refine their strategies and enable them to build a robust, diversified long-term investment portfolio.

## Overview
To build our recommendation system, we have developed a hybrid model that combines content-based filtering with collaborative filtering techniques. This system starts by analyzing historical data and characteristics of S&P 500 stocks, including price ratios, market capitalization, and sector information. Using a content-based approach, we create profiles for each stock based on these attributes. These profiles help in determining stocks that are similar to each other, enabling us to recommend stocks similar to those that an investor is already considering or has invested in.

## Methodology
### Content-Based Filtering
- **Data Analysis:** We analyze historical data and characteristics of S&P 500 stocks.
- **Attribute Profiling:**  Create profiles for each stock based on price ratios, market capitalization, and sector information.
- **Similarity Calculation:** Determine stocks similar to those an investor is interested in.

### Collaborative-Based Filtering
- **Surprise Library:** Employ matrix factorization techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
- **Latent Factors:**  Leverage latent factors derived from analyst recommendations.
- **Preference Prediction:** Predict how highly an analyst might rate unknown stocks based on similarities to known preferences regarding the target stock.

## Integrated Approach
By integrating content-based and collaborative filtering approaches, our recommendation system not only identifies stocks similar to a given reference stock but also predicts potential analyst satisfaction with these stocks, ranked by their predicted ratings. The final output is a list of the top ten recommended stocks that align closely with the investor's existing portfolio while also considering broader market sentiments and trends.

This methodology ensures that our recommendations are both data-driven and finely tuned to individual investment styles, ultimately helping investors make more strategic, data-informed investment decisions.
